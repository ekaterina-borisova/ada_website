 What impact does geography have on the development of drugs? Specifically, does drug's origin matter in drug-drug interaction? The development of pharmaceuticals is a collaborative effort that often reflects the expertise and innovation of the institutions behind them. This project aims to investigate whether drugs developed within the same institutions exhibit superior interaction profiles compared to those developed independently. One may hypothesise that shared research environments, methodologies, and collaborative networks contribute to a higher likelihood of favorable interactions among drugs originating from the same institution.

 Does the prevalence of a disease in a region have an effect on local drug development? The world is highly interconnected and an outbreak of any disease anywhere is today a menace for the whole world. Are there however any trends one can observe in the location of drug research with respect to the geographical prevalence of a disease?

			<h2>Some Analysis on BindingDB Dataset</h2>
		</header>
		<p>To answer these questions, we use the BindingDB dataset. It provides information on the interactions between proteins and ligands, focusing on binding affinity data. It contains 2,937,206 results on 1,295,089 ligands and 6746 targets. In total, there are 330 different source organisms for the targets. BindingDB provides a lot of data for each experiment, there are 194 columns. For each experiment, we have the binding affinities constants such as Ki, Kd, IC50 and EC50, we have the ligandâ€™s SMILES representation, the target name, the target source organism and the institution where the experiment was made. Since we want to make a geographical analysis of the trends of research, we focused on institutions that are located only in one country (some companies have multiple faculties in different countries).</p>

			<h2>WHO database</h2>

		<p>
			Up until now, we have analyzed the BindingDB database. To perform a comparative analysis of research output and disease prevalence, we need data on the prevalence of the diseases studied in the BindingDB dataset. For this purpose, we will use data from the World Health Organization (WHO), available at the following link: <a href="https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/" target="_blank">https://ghoapi.azureedge.net/api/</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			After reviewing the WHO database, we identified eight diseases that appear in both the WHO and BindingDB datasets. These diseases are:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Plasmodium falciparum</li>
			<li>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</li>
			<li>Poliovirus</li>
			<li>Plasmodium vivax</li>
			<li>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</li>
			<li>Escherichia coli</li>
			<li>Hepatitis C</li>
			<li>Staphylococcus aureus</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For each disease, data on the prevalence in different countries is available from WHO. The heatmap below shows the prevalences per capita of these diseases in different regions of the world in proportion to each other:

			<h2>Prevalence-Research Analysis</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Having data on quantity of research and disease prevalence in different countries, we can now analyze the relationship between the two. The question of how the prevalence of a disease in a region drives the amount and focus of research conducted there can be answered by comparing the two datasets.

			For each disease, we depict below the prevalence of the given disease against the number of experiments conducted on it:

			{% include plot_HIV.html %}
			{% include plot_Poliovirus.html %}
			{% include plot_Plasmodium_vivax.html %}
			{% include plot_Tuberculosis.html %}
			{% include plot_Hepatitis_C.html %}
			{% include plot_Escherichia_coli.html %}
			{% include plot_Staphylococcus_aureus.html %}

		</p>

<!-- Three -->
<section id="three">
	<div class="inner">
		<p>From the graphs we observe that many countries with high prevalence of a disease do not necessarily have a high number of experiments conducted on it. On the other hand, countries with low prevalence of a disease can have a high number of experiments conducted on it. This makes sense, as many countries with high prevalence of a disease might not have the resources to conduct research on it, while countries with low prevalence might have the resources to conduct research on it.  </p>

		<p>
			To better quantify the relationship between prevalence and research, we perform a linear regression analysis on the data. We seek to find how well the prevalence of a disease in a region predicts the number of experiments conducted on it in that region. The results of the linear regression analysis are visualized in the following heatmap.

				<p>The numbers and colors shown can be best described as measures of the proportions of research conducted in a region given the proportions of a disease's prevalence per capita in a region. Observing the diagonal, we can in effect observe that the relationship between prevalence and research is in general not very strong within regions. There are however, there are some relationships in between regions that appear to be stronger. For example, the relationship between prevalence in Western Pacific and research in the Americas seems to be strongly positive. However, we cannot safely make any conclusions from this analysis, as none of the results are statistically significant (p-values are all above 0.10).</p>

All these cases describe relationships where geographical proportions of disease prevalence per capita predict the proportions of research conducted on the disease in a certain country.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The analysis shows that there are indeed some relationships between the prevalence of a disease in a region and the amount of research conducted on it in some countries. However, few results are statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between disease prevalence and research in geographical terms is not very strong, but does exist in some cases. In reality, there are many other factors that can affect the amount of research conducted on a disease, such as the resources available in a country, which probably have a greater impact on the amount of research conducted.
